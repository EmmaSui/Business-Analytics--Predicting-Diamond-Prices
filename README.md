# Business-Analytics--Predicting-Diamond-Prices
This project was completed to practice multiple linear regression model and data visualization. The original data and project was created by Udacity, from the Nanodegree 'Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree. The original project provided the linear regression formula, but for practice purposes, I used python to build the model and calculated my own formula which is similar to the function provided by Udacity.

## Project Overview

A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, I used the data to run multiple linear regression model to get the function to predict the diamond prices, and then created graphs based on the results.

## Packages used
pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels
